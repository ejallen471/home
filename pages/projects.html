        <p>
            From January 2023 to June 2023 I completed research with Professor Gang Chen at UCLA. The broad focus was looking at temperature data from 1980 to 2020 using  
            statistical analysis and machine learning methods.

        <p>
            As part of the 115C quantum mechanics course at UCLA, I conducted research and wrote a paper explaining the BB84 protocol
            and quantum key distribution. I focused on how the protocol works and what implications it could have in the future, particurarly with 
            the advent of quantum computing.

        <p>
            I completed this project for the Machine Learning For the Physical Sciences course at the UCLA in fall 2023
            The aim of this project is to find the best model to classify emails as spam.

        <h2><a href="../projects/groversAlgorithm/groversAlgorithm.html">Grover's Algorithm</a></h2>

        <p>
            During a summer internship, I completed a self led project based on Grover's Algorithm. Using python, i implemented a classical and quantum approach
            to the unstructured sort problem and testing the runtime. The results were in line with the literature; namely using grover's algorithm provided
            quadratic speed up with comparision with a classical method.

        <h2><a href="../projects/solarSystemSimulation/solarSystemSimulation.html">Solar System Simulation</a></h2>

        <p>
            I created this project as part of the computer simulation course at the University of Edinburgh in my second year (2023).
            The project aims were to visualise the plantary orbits of the solar system and conduct different experiments related to energy conservation 
            and integration techniques.
