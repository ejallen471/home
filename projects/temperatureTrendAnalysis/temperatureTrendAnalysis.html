                    From January 2023 to June 2023 I have completed research with Professor Gang Chen. The broad focus was on temperature trend analysis with 
                    machine learning methods.

                    In winter quarter I focused on focused on analysing key statistical properties—mean temperature, variance, and skewness—of Northern 
                    Hemisphere temperature datasets from 1980 to 2020. My analysis utilised data from ERA5, the fifth generation of 
                    ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis, produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service. This work gave me a general understanding of the data.
                    
                    In spring quarter I continued using the same data, the primary objective was to produce a detailed temporal and spatial analysis of
                    temperature variability in the Northern Hemisphere using Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis. This work also involved 
                    investigating auto-correlation and cross-correlation to better understand sub-seasonal variability.
